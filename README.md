Adventure
=========

An interactive fiction engine. Yup, that was an original name.

The aim of this project is my personal amusement and a learning journey. I've always been interested in parsing and was curious about text adventures and how "the computer" was able to "understand" what you typed.

I attempted to do something similar a few times in the past years and failed miserably. I think I finally have the expertise to do something decent or at least, functional.

Now, onto the project itself. The idea is to have an interaction fiction engine which is able to process fiction expressed as script files. The main goals are:

 * Fictions should be text only. At least for now.
 * Fictions should be defined in text files.
 * The same engine should run different fictions
 * You should need only a text editor to write one (no programming).
 * It should fairly flexible and generic (like not having fiction stuff hardcoded in the engine code).
 * Fictions should be playable and fun :)

By keeping small achievable goals is the only way I can succeed. The first milestone ('avatar') should pick a playable fiction from a script file and be fully playable. No fancy features, just playable. There will be room later to do more complex stuff.

Some random ideas for future features:

 * Support for more complex stuff, operators, etc
 * Stackable / countable objects
 * Dialogs
 * Timed events
 * Combat!
 * Multi user
 * You name it!
 
There, it was my first attempt at explaining what this project is about in one short file.

Enjoy!
